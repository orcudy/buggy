##Running
1. download zip
2. navigate to root directory
3. `make`
4. `cd sandbox`

The Makefile shows how to use all options of the program, including:
1. copying arbitrary code
2. executing arbitrary code
3. deleting files
4. doing all of the above recursively through the file system <-- dragons here
