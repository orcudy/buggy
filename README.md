##Running
1. download zip
2. navigate to root directory
3. `make`

This creates a sandbox which contains nested directories and four shell scripts. Running each shell script produces a different action:

1. **main.sh**: executes `a.out` in each subdirectory recursively leading to the creation of the `message.txt` file in each subdirectory    

2. **undo-main.sh**: removes the `message.txt` file from each subdirectory  

3. **license.sh**: copies the GPL to each subdirectory recursively  

4. **undo-license.sh**: remove the GPL from each subdirectoy recursively

Each script was generated by the buggy.sh script, details can be found in the Makefile.
